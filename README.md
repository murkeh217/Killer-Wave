# Killer-Wave

Title: Killer Wave

Genre: Side-scrolling shooter

Platform: PC/Mobile

Target audience: Age 10+

Game concept: In space with enemies rushing past the player, players need to shoot and
destroy as many enemies as possible within a limited number of lives before the end of
the level. Enemies come in two forms—wave and flee. The third level will feature a large
flying-robot boss that the player will chase off.

Game flow and mechanics: The player will be in a small spaceship that can be controlled
with the keyboard/joypad cursor controls and fired with the Ctrl or Command key from
its position and can travel right. The level will end when the player has traveled to the end
of the stage from left to right.

Constraints: The player has three lives when the game is not connected to the internet.
The player will be contained within the screen boundaries.

Visuals: HUD—in-game score, in-game lives, game title, level title, game-over title.

Enemy wave: Featured in all three levels. These enemies will be instantiated to travel in a
sine-wave pattern moving at a slow rate from the right to the left of the screen. The enemy
will fly independently or within a group of the same enemy type, creating a trail.

Enemy flees: This enemy will be placed in dotted areas of the third level. Their behavior
will move away from the player if in range. If the range is lost, the enemy remains still. If
contact is made with the player, the player will lose health and the enemy will die.

Enemy boss: The boss is seen during the third level and greets the player, only to then
zoom off out of the screen view with the player automatically chasing them.
